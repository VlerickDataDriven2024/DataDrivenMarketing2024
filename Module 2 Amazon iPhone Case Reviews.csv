I'm not at all rough with it. It's either in my pocket or on my desk most of the time. The bottom silicone piece that protects the speakers and charging port is completely separated from the hard plastic. I'm pretty disappointed. Otterbox has always been a company that I could rely on for long periods of time. However, I still hold true to my statement about the magnetic ring. It works perfectly. I just wish it wasn't falling apart.

I've never had an issue with Otterbox and this case is no exception. It's perfect as always. I've had an Otterbox or two for every phone I've had for the last 12 years. They have never failed me. This particular case is very sleek and smooth. It gives your phone a nice thin look but also seems to protect it pretty well. All of the buttons line up perfectly and it fits the phone perfectly snug. The Magsafe aspect of it is really nice as well. It works just as you'd hope it does. I have no complaints.","5.0 out of 5 stars"

I inspected the phone case closely and it does have the Otterbox logo on the side.  Thinking it might be valid, going from one star to three (because of late delivery and packing material not the original box).

This was about a week late (maybe more) and it didn’t arrive in any box, just a clear plastic bag.  I don’t know if it’s a true Otterbox and not willing to take a change w my iPhone.  Returning!","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"1706604080-15","https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Symmetry-Antimicrobial-MagSafe-iPhone/product-reviews/B09LPLF4K7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews","Pretty Case, but I'd rather have saved some money on a cheaper one","To be clear, I do like the design of this case.  It feels more premium than some of the cheaper models online with a good mix of a hard back (to help with wireless charging) and the soft bumper around the edge. This should be expected of a company like OtterBox at this point and at this price point.

I have dropped the phone once or twice from roughly 3 feet up  without a sign of damage to the device, so it does its job well.

However, I have to give it two stars for how poorly it has held up now that I'm almost one year to the day since I ordered it.

As you can see in the photos, the device yellows/browns pretty severely on about half the case (mostly the contact points for buttons and the charge port. Additionally, I noticed that the bottom of the case has started to completely separate.  Finally, as my finger points to in the image of the magsafe outline, the rectangular piece has fully fallen out of the case.  It is at least stuck to the back of my phone, so everything still functions, but worth noting.

I wouldn't care so much about the discoloration if this case weren't 2-3x the cost of some of the usual cases I've bought on here and if this hadn't all happened in under a year! My case on my last iPhone was roughly $10 and lasted 3 years before needing a replacement.  I'll be replacing this with something cheaper.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

It’s a hard plastic back and flexible bumper. Keeps my phone protected from falls and scratches. Only complaints are that the soft plastic always yellows and the little anchor magnet fell out when I took the case off. Honestly looks a little rough for only using it for 6 months but it’s cheaper than the apple case and probably provides better protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars"

This baby works wonders when hitting the potholes of Atlanta and never falls off.

Rubber bumper insert on the case yellowed pretty bad, few weeks ago it started warping and does not look good. Also back is all scratched up. It is not like I have my keys in my pockets along with my phone. This may be mainly caused by it being on car mag chargers.

Thought going with Otterbox brand over a generic brand would give me better quality but I can see I am wrong.","2.0 out of 5 stars"

Unfortunately, this case just didn’t last. The bottom completely separated from the case. It made it hard to charge, especially on stand chargers so it defeated the point of the MagSafe piece.

But the yellowing of the silicone is crazy. This is my second case from them because I really did like it. So this second one was kept out of the sun completely and babied. It yellowed just as quick.

It has a sturdy feel to it, however, the lining on the case has reliability issues as I purchased a clear case 5 months ago and the lining has turned a greenish color. The lining has also separated from the hard plastic near the charging port due to repeatedly pulling out of my pocket. I haven’t used a mag safe charger but the bottom magnet has become loose and sometimes falls out. I purchased this case because otter box makes sturdy cases but for the money being spent you could buy multiple cheap cases that will not look aged in as short a time.

I love that it doesn't take away from the look of the iPhone.  I had a solid case on my 13 pro for a while but didn't like that it took away from the look and color of the phone. This case is very easy to hold and does a great job of protecting the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars"
